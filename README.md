# wikipedia_game
This was an attempt to make a script that could solve the wikipedia game. The goal of this game is to finding the path between two wikipedia pages that has the minimum number of links. The goal was to improve improve with accessing apis and searching on a large scale. 
This is an undirected shortest path problem, so I used a breadth first search. To speed this up, I searched from both directions, as wikipedia allows the access of both front links (the pages a page links to) and back links (the pages that link to a page). While I knew that the amount of pages that would need to look at could be exponential in the lenght of the path, I severly underestimated how many links a page has and how much time it would take to get all the links from a page. Because of this, it takes an unreasonable amount of time to find even a path of lenght 3, so this project has been abandoned.
